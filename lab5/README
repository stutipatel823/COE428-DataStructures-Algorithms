     WOrks
     
  Part 2:
     Works on Geany
     
  Part 3:
     No errors but I couldn't figure out why its not working.
     
***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:
 I had no hash table collision method because my hash function was created in a way that it would
always give me a unique key value for every word that I put. Example hi=317 but ih=318. check out my "try.c" to see how it works.
 
 
 
 
 Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:
I used a multiplication method. key = n*key+tag[i];
key  = index
tag[i] = letter
n =2

I converted string to int by using casting method
 
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
