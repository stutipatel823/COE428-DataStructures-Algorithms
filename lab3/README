I have three txt files one for "best" case, "worse" case and a "random" that were used to test the sort codes.

INSERTION SORT:
- Everything Worked. All txt files were sorted when they were called in command prompt. The code also worked when I manually inputted the values.
- I used the code from lab 1 and replaced some parts of the code with myCompare, mySwap and myCopy.

	Best Case:
	Comparisons: n-1  = O(n)
	Swaps: 0
	Copies: O(n)

	Average Case:
	Comparisons: O(n(n-1)/2)
	Swaps: O(n(n-1)/2)
	Copies: O(n)

	Worse Case:
	Comparisons: O(n(n-1)/2)
	Swaps: O(n(n-1)/2)
	Copies: O(n)

MERGE SORT:
- Everything Worked. All txt files were sorted when they were called in command prompt. The code also worked when I manually inputted the values.
- I watched a youtube video that helped me better understand the merge sort algorithm. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHkDBEumP0)

	Best Case:
	Comparisons: n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))
	Swaps: 0
	Copies: n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))

	Average Case:
	Comparisons:n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))
	Swaps: 0
	Copies: n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))

	Worse Case:
	Comparisons:n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))
	Swaps: 0
	Copies: n/2 + n/2 +n = O(nlog(n))
